# Computational Chemistry: A course

#### ***Author: Elizabeth Granda, Bachelor´s Student of Scientific Computing***

The following repository aims to present some of the task proposed for the Computational Chemistry course in the Scientific Computing program at University of Medellin. It showcases the most revelant tasks where we learned about molecule´s simmetry, geommetry and classification; surfaces construction using Atomical Simulation Environment (ASE); the catalytic cyclefor the transformation of carbon oxides into methanol on solid surfaces; data mining for material analysis, etc.
